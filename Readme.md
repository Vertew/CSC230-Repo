## CSC230 Software Engineering Project - "Labyrinth"

Labyrinth is unsurprisingly a digital recreation of the board game of the same name. It was made by me and a team of seven other students over the course of roughly 2 weeks (not including prior planning and prep time) as part of a Software Engineering course at Swansea University. The game was programmed in Java, using JavaFX to provide the visual elements. Much of the focus of the course was around the ability to actually coordinate the team, organise regular meetings, break down the problem into multiple tasks for each team member, and effectively communicate so that each member was able to contribute. We also learned about and put to use fundamental team based software engineering and development practices and workflows during the planning and production proccesses. I acted as team leader throughout the process, leading meetings and handling the organisation of the sub groups among the team members and task delegation. We achieved a first class result.
